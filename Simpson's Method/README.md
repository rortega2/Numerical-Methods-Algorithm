# Simpson 1/3 Rule
Uses Simpson's 1/3 Rules and Trapezoidal Rule to evaluate the integral for a set of tabulated data.
### Input:
* x - Vector x
* y - Vector y
### Output:
* I = Evaluatted Integral for the function of values y wit respect to x

## Disclaimer
This MATLAB is functional with its limited use. Although Simpson's 1/3 Rule is better suited for data 
with an even number of segments, Trapezoidal Rule will be used on the last interval.
