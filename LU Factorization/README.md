MATLAB Funciton that uses LU decompostion on a square matrix to ouput its respective lower, upper, and pivot matrix
### Input:
* A - Square Coefficient Matrix
### Output:
* L - Lower Triangular Matrix
* U - Upper Triangular Matrix
* P - Pivot Matrix

## Disclaimer
This MATLAB function is functional for specific squre matrices, however a lot more work is needed.
